# 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset  

This project demonstrates how to implement and visualize a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the famous **Iris flower dataset**. 
It is a beginner-friendly project to understand how decision trees work in machine learning.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Iris Dataset** (included in scikit-learn)  
- Contains **150 samples** of iris flowers with 4 features:  
  - Sepal Length  
  - Sepal Width  
  - Petal Length  
  - Petal Width  
- Target: Predict the **species** of iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – machine learning (DecisionTreeClassifier, train_test_split, accuracy_score, etc.)  

---

## 🚀 Steps in the Project  
1. Import and explore the Iris dataset  
2. Visualize dataset features  
3. Split dataset into **train** and **test** sets  
4. Train a **Decision Tree Classifier**  
5. Make predictions on the test set  
6. Evaluate model performance (accuracy)  
7. Visualize the trained decision tree  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Achieved **high accuracy** on test data (typically ~95%+).  
- Decision tree visualization helps understand feature splits.
